                <p class="p-3">Supplementary Education Centres (SEC) were initiated in the year 2000 with the prime objective to improve the quality of education, sustain childrenâ€™s interest in education, and prevent school dropout and child labour. The SECs are now functional in 15 villages and 10 slums and cater to 600 children. 5th to 10th standard students participate in extracurricular activities and get trained in the domain of their interest and potential under the guidance of our trained teachers. Tuition support is provided for 2-3 hours in the evenings to assist students in clearing their doubts and completing their homeworks. Children facing difficulties in school tuition are given reading and writing enhancement programmes.
                  Regular monitoring helps us keep track of the overall learning progress of children and sustain efforts towards quality education. The average % of marks obtained by SEC students in the 10th standard public examinations has improved from below  50% to 86% in the past 9 years. <br>
                  Children are motivated and guided to choose their career wisely. Students who pass the 10th standard are assisted with career counselling and training programmes.
                  Health and educational programmes are conducted in tent-schools for child labourers and children from migrant families. RLHP restores drinking water facilities in such schools and supports the children with educational materials including books, pens, pencils, bags, uniforms, LCD computers.</p>
