              <p class="feedback-text">“My name is Naziya. My husband left me and our 3 children a few years ago.My children and I now live with my mother, and she works as a beedi roller to feed the family. Unfortunately, I met with an accident and had a paralysis attack, which made my left leg and hand dysfunctional. Lockdown brought a challenging time to us. We would eat only one meal a day. It was difficult to feed the children even during normal days and lockdown made the situation much worse. RLHP’s support during such a struggling period was the best thing that happened during lockdown. They provided us with food packets and we are very grateful for their kind work.”</p>

              <p class="feedback-text"> “In the year 1998, RLHP members approached me, and I joined Asha Bhavana where my journey towards a better life began. I lost my mother when I was 2 year old, and hence, stayed at my uncle’s place in Kollegala, where I was treated like a domestic servant. When I recall my childhood days, I see darkness. Kollegala, a small village, had people with blind beliefs and child marriage was common. I have seen young girls get married and become mothers of two-three kids. When I was 10 years old, I used to attend programmes conducted by RLHP regarding awareness about child issues. These programmes made me think about my rights and in the year 1998, my aunt sent me with the RLHP team and I started my education journey. I ended up doing a D.Ed course and a diploma in tailoring which landed me a job in a government hostel. I also worked with RLHP for a while. I’m a mother to two daughters now. I married Jagadeesh, a paint contractor. I met him through my mother-in-law, who is a member of Dwani Federation. With opportunities given by RLHP, I now have a free and happy life, and as RLHP continues its good cause, I would be contributing in any way possible.”</p>

              <p class="feedback-text">“Losing my mother when I was 9 years old was the toughest phase of my life. My father was an alcoholic and never cared for me. With my mother gone, who was the sole breadwinner of my family, I landed up on the street. In the mid 90s, RLHP members found me near Town hall and they enquired about me and my family. I was enrolled in class 5 with help from RLHP, I completed my schooling and then did a diploma in automobile engineering and secured a government job. I completed my engineering degree by attending evening classes. I received a helping hand from RLHP and I am really grateful towards them for supporting and motivating me for twenty years. I have a dream of helping them and supporting their project of providing education to destitute children.”</p>
