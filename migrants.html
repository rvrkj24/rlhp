            RLHP’s intervention with the migrant families aims at addressing the well-being of the children by creating a lasting network system with the local community and government to eradicate poverty and ensure sustainable solutions for child labourers and children from migrant families.
            <br>

                <p class="p-4">
                  The primary focus of our project on child rights for children from migrant families was monitoring the 331 migrants and 33 left behind children during the time of seasonal migration (November - March).  These children were supported with special care and protection through regular home visits by the RLHP staff. The children were also monitored through different community groups such as Child Protection Committee (CPC), women and youth groups, panchayat members, government school and anganwadi teachers, activity teachers of RLHP etc. With the intention of protecting these migrant families and children, RLHP capacitated these groups with a plethora of training programmes, workshops, seminars, public meeting on JJ act, RTE, leadership training, life skill etc. As an impact of these trainings, 12 drop out children were enrolled back to school, Children started continuing the school after long holidays, 137 Children participated in gram sabha and started seeking the government support for their constraints.
Also, RLHP developed a tracking mechanism to track the economic and social condition of the migrating families during the time of migration.  The old 331 children and 128 newly migrated children’s status was tracked through the tracking mechanism. The collaborative involvement of panchayath, community representatives and CPC members helped to identify the problems faced by the families. Grama Panchayat started registering the migration details of each family and providing necessary supportive measures such as MGNREGA schemes in their source villages.

                <p class="p-4">
                  RLHP intends to provide education for the children from migrant families who miss out on their studies during the time of migration. In collaboration with the education department of Kerala and Karnataka RLHP has taken initiative to commence a temporary school for the migrant children both at their own village and migrating destination areas.  People’s migration from the Gundulpet taluk is very prevalent from the past 40 years and for the first time in the history, the government has started addressing the issues of migrants. Moreover, parents of the migrant children started giving more care and support for their education. 
                  As an impact of these programmes, children are getting scholarships, 20 women have received tailoring training with the support of RLHP and Gram Panchayat, 116 senior citizen members had their pension problems resolved and received four months pension. 529 families got new job cards, 64 families renewed their job cards and more than 1200 people worked under MGNREGA in 6 villages.
