          “RLHP’s supplementary education and career guidance session were very useful for me and helped me a lot.” says Sulthana, 16 year old teenager residing in N.H.Palya slum. 
          Sulthana’s family of seven lived in a small rented house. She studied at government school and had difficulty understanding English and Mathematics. Hailing from an economically vulnerable family, she couldn't afford extra tuition. 
          RLHP initiated a Supplementary Education Centre in N.H.Palya Slum, and Sulthana , along with 15 other students, received guidance for 10th std exam from an experienced teacher. Career guidance and motivation from RLHP staff to the SSLC students gave them a direction for a successful career.

      Prajwal, a 3.7 year-old child from Hosalli village was identified as weak during the field visit by the RLHP team members.  While his ideal weight should have been 15.5 kg for a child his age, he weighed 3 kg less as per the initial assessment.  The family was not aware of the need for nutritious food. The RLHP team oriented the family on nutritious food and its significance in maintaining the physical and mental wellbeing of the child. RLHP also equipped the family with nutrient rich foods items like ragi and eggs and followed up regularly to track Prajwal’s progress. 
      At present, Prajwal eats more nutritious food and is physically more active and has gained weight. His parents are providing more nutritious mixtures and food for the child and are very much happy with the improvement.

My husband left me and our 3 children a few years ago.My children and I now live with my mother, and she works as a beedi roller to feed the family. Unfortunately, I met with an accident and had a paralysis attack, which made my left leg and hand dysfunctional. Lockdown brought a challenging time to us. We would eat only one meal a day. It was difficult to feed the children even during normal days and lockdown made the situation much worse. RLHP’s support during such a struggling period was the best thing that happened during lockdown. They provided us with food packets and we are very grateful for their kind work.”</p>

I lost my mother when I was 2 year old, and hence, stayed at my uncle’s place in Kollegala, where I was treated like a domestic servant. When I recall my childhood days, I see darkness. Kollegala, a small village, had people with blind beliefs and child marriage was common. I have seen young girls get married and become mothers of two-three kids. When I was 10 years old, I used to attend programmes conducted by RLHP regarding awareness about child issues. These programmes made me think about my rights and in the year 1998, my aunt sent me with the RLHP team and I started my education journey. I ended up doing a D.Ed course and a diploma in tailoring which landed me a job in a government hostel. I also worked with RLHP for a while. I’m a mother to two daughters now. I married Jagadeesh, a paint contractor. I met him through my mother-in-law, who is a member of Dwani Federation. With opportunities given by RLHP, I now have a free and happy life, and as RLHP continues its good cause, I would be contributing in any way possible.”</p>

With my mother gone, who was the sole breadwinner of my family, I landed up on the street. In the mid 90s, RLHP members found me near Town hall and they enquired about me and my family. I was enrolled in class 5 with help from RLHP, I completed my schooling and then did a diploma in automobile engineering and secured a government job. I completed my engineering degree by attending evening classes. I received a helping hand from RLHP and I am really grateful towards them for supporting and motivating me for twenty years. I have a dream of helping them and supporting their project of providing education to destitute children.”</p>
