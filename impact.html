            Rajeshwari. M, joined Ashabhavana at the age of 6. Her family, including her mother and her 4 year old sister, Priyanka, used to beg and live on the streets. The children were malnourished and in critical health condition. RHLP’s outreach programmes identified and counselled these children and offered them accommodation at Ashabhavana, a home away from home. Initially, their mother used to visit them at Ashabhavana but stopped coming eventually.The children were provided with supplementary food and extra educational support and they quickly adapted and started living a better life with a focus to be self-reliant.  After completing schooling, Rajeshwari joined as a home nurse in June 2016 at Ganesha Clinic in Mysore while her sister continued pursuing an education.

            In 2011, Narayan, a 14 year old orphan boy who worked as a child labourer at a house, was found wandering the streets of Mysore. On witnessing that the boy was physically and mentally tortured by the family, the neighbours called the 1098 RLHP Childline and reported the plight of the boy. RHLP, with the support of a government-allied system, rescued the boy and brought him under the care of Child Welfare Committee. He was later given shelter at Ashakirana Shelter Home on request of the committee. Initially, he had difficulty adjusting to the new environment and was weak and unhealthy.

After five months of counselling and care, he was enrolled in the 7th standard where he continued his studies for SSLC exam and went on to score first class. Narayan had an interest in cooking and dreamt of becoming a chef. He was thus given an opportunity to join a Hotel Management course at St. Philomena College. He successfully completed his education and secured a good paid job at Green Hotel, Mysuru, with a starting salary of Rs.6000 per month.

          Livelihood opportunities are vulnerable for the inhabitants of Kuthnuru village because of which they migrate to Kerala every year for better employment opportunities.

Gram Panchayat members and authorities were not taking any measure to improve the well-being of the villagers even when there was an increased prevalence of child labour, child marriage and domestic violence. With the intervention of RLHP in 2018, the villagers became aware of government schemes that they weren't aware of before and started supporting available programmes.

    <em>Prajwal’s journey from being malnourished to healthy child </em>
    </h6>
    <p class="text-white small pr-5">
      Prajwal, a 3.7 year-old child from Hosalli village was identified as weak during the field visit by the RLHP team members.  While his ideal weight should have been 15.5 kg for a child his age, he weighed 3 kg less as per the initial assessment.  The family was not aware of the need for nutritious food. The RLHP team oriented the family on nutritious food and its significance in maintaining the physical and mental wellbeing of the child. RLHP also equipped the family with nutrient rich foods items like ragi and eggs and followed up regularly to track Prajwal’s progress. 
      At present, Prajwal eats more nutritious food and is physically more active and has gained weight. His parents are providing more nutritious mixtures and food for the child and are very much happy with the improvement.

        <p class="feedback-text">“My name is Naziya. My husband left me and our 3 children a few years ago.My children and I now live with my mother, and she works as a beedi roller to feed the family. Unfortunately, I met with an accident and had a paralysis attack, which made my left leg and hand dysfunctional. Lockdown brought a challenging time to us. We would eat only one meal a day. It was difficult to feed the children even during normal days and lockdown made the situation much worse. RLHP’s support during such a struggling period was the best thing that happened during lockdown. They provided us with food packets and we are very grateful for their kind work.”</p>

        <p class="feedback-text"> “In the year 1998, RLHP members approached me, and I joined Asha Bhavana where my journey towards a better life began. I lost my mother when I was 2 year old, and hence, stayed at my uncle’s place in Kollegala, where I was treated like a domestic servant. When I recall my childhood days, I see darkness. Kollegala, a small village, had people with blind beliefs and child marriage was common. I have seen young girls get married and become mothers of two-three kids. When I was 10 years old, I used to attend programmes conducted by RLHP regarding awareness about child issues. These programmes made me think about my rights and in the year 1998, my aunt sent me with the RLHP team and I started my education journey. I ended up doing a D.Ed course and a diploma in tailoring which landed me a job in a government hostel. I also worked with RLHP for a while. I’m a mother to two daughters now. I married Jagadeesh, a paint contractor. I met him through my mother-in-law, who is a member of Dwani Federation. With opportunities given by RLHP, I now have a free and happy life, and as RLHP continues its good cause, I would be contributing in any way possible.”</p>

        <p class="feedback-text">“Losing my mother when I was 9 years old was the toughest phase of my life. My father was an alcoholic and never cared for me. With my mother gone, who was the sole breadwinner of my family, I landed up on the street. In the mid 90s, RLHP members found me near Town hall and they enquired about me and my family. I was enrolled in class 5 with help from RLHP, I completed my schooling and then did a diploma in automobile engineering and secured a government job. I completed my engineering degree by attending evening classes. I received a helping hand from RLHP and I am really grateful towards them for supporting and motivating me for twenty years. I have a dream of helping them and supporting their project of providing education to destitute children.”</p>
